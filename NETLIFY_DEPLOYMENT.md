### **Method 2: Git Integration (Recommended)**
1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
2. In Netlify: "New site from Git"
3. Connect your repository
4. Set build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
5. Deploy! Netlify will auto-deploy on every push

## ⚙️ **Environment Variables Setup**

### **Required Variables**
Go to Site Settings → Environment Variables in Netlify:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

### **How to Set**
1. In Netlify dashboard, go to your site
2. Site Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add each variable with its value
4. Redeploy (or trigger a new build)

## 🔧 **Post-Deployment Configuration**

### **1. Custom Domain (Optional)**
- Site Settings → Domain Management
- Add your custom domain
- Configure DNS settings with your domain provider

### **2. HTTPS & Security**
- Netlify provides free SSL certificates automatically
- Force HTTPS redirect in Site Settings

### **3. Form Handling**
- If you add contact forms, enable form handling in Netlify
- View form submissions in the dashboard

## 📱 **Testing Your Live Site**

### **Checklist**
- [ ] ✅ Homepage loads with hero logo
- [ ] ✅ Navigation bar shows main logo
- [ ] ✅ All routes work (Services, Stylists, Booking, etc.)
- [ ] ✅ Mobile responsive design
- [ ] ✅ Favicon appears in browser tab
- [ ] ✅ Images and assets load correctly

### **Common Issues & Solutions**
- **404 errors**: Check `_redirects` file and `netlify.toml`
- **Missing logos**: Ensure all SVG files are in `dist` folder
- **Routing issues**: Verify client-side routing is working

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

### **Backend Hosting**
- Your MongoDB backend needs separate hosting
- Update API URLs in frontend to point to hosted backend
- Consider: Heroku, Railway, Render, or DigitalOcean

### **API Configuration**
- Update `src/config.js` with production API URLs
- Ensure CORS is configured on your backend
- Test all API endpoints after deployment

## 🔄 **Future Updates**

### **Automatic Deployment (Git Integration)**
- Every push to main branch triggers new deployment
- Netlify builds and deploys automatically
- Preview deployments for pull requests

### **Manual Deployment (Drag & Drop)**
- Run `deploy.bat` to rebuild
- Drag new `dist` folder to Netlify
- Instant updates
